# Data-scraping-project
This project is about scraping data of second-hand item and store in an SQL database
The data is from Israeli second hand items site.
I used 'BeautifulSoup' package to get the URLs of all data pages in the site.
Later, used the 'selenium' package on chrome browser to access relevant data on the page and by using the HTML script to scrape the needed data.
The script is connected to SQL database and stores the data scraped.
